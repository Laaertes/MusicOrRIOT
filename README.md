Software Engineering 1 Project
================================
In order to run this you must be able to run a website off of local host.
To run a website off of local host you will need have an apache2 instance that supports mysql and php on which ever
operating system you have (windows, osx, linux, etc.)
Then unzip this file and place the contents in the appropriate directory for your system.
You should then be able to see the website by opening up your browser and typing in:
localhost/<file path to the public/index.php file from the website package>

Too see this example on the web go to: http://104.131.231.237/

Warning
=========
Some functions do not work correctly when not on a webserver
